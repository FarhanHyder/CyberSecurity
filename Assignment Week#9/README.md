# Week 9 Project: Honeypot


## Which Honeypot(s) you deployed



## Any issues you encountered
- There are lots of issues when I followed the instruction on the codepath, such as permmision deny and Could not fetch resource. The issue that most frequently faced is the session timeout while trying to install MHN admin application. The installation would go half way with some of the parameters set and halt in the middle giving me the message of connection time out. The next time the install command is run, the already set parameters would interfere with the new installations and give some error messageses including database error.
